Heart Disease Classification Using Backpropagation
This program implements a backpropagation neural network to classify heart disease in patients based on medical data. The model analyzes input features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The goal is to assist medical professionals in early detection and effective decision-making.

## dataset
16 input feature, 2 output (1 / 0), with 1000- row of data.
